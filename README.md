special instructions - Since I wrote this code in Unity it is a little complicated to run the scripts. I am not fluent in the Unity studio so I am not exactly sure how best for
                  you all to run my code. For safety in my demo video I will show you a full running of the game, as well as changing the code that I show in the demo during the 
                  the video so you know the code you have in front of you was what I was running during the demo. If you wanted to run my code this would be what I recommend...
                  Download unity hub and unity if you do not already have it. Once you have it running I have put in this github a file called 'final scene',
                  Go to file at the top lef of the screen and select 'open scene', from there select my file 'final scene'. once selected and loaded (you should see 2 gladiators                     and a colosseum on your screen) press the play button at the top of the screen, this will let you play the game. Once it is playing, use 'W A S D' keys and the                     'UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT' arrows to control the respective players. First to 5 points wins. Now like I said I am not an expert on Unity so im sorry if the above                          instructions are confusing, i tried my best.
