This is unity game created using C#. You can watch a demo of this object-orieted coded unity game through the mp4 file present above.

language version - C#

file information - The files 'sidewall', 'playerControls', 'GameManager' and 'BallControls' house all of the C# code that I wrote. the file 'Final Scene' is what is needed by unity in order to play the game, it contains all of the scripts, there models and positions on the screen.

special instructions - Since I wrote this code in Unity it is a little complicated to run the scripts. I am not fluent in the Unity studio so I am not exactly sure how best for you all to run my code. For safety in my demo video I will show you a full running of the game, as well as changing the code that I show in the demo during the 
the video so you know the code you have in front of you was what I was running during the demo. If you wanted to run my code this would be what I recommend...
                  Download unity hub and unity if you do not already have it. Once you have it running I have put in this github a file called 'final scene',
                  Go to file at the top lef of the screen and select 'open scene', from there select my file 'final scene'. once selected and loaded (you should see 2 gladiators and a colosseum on your screen) press the play button at the top of the screen, this will let you play the game. Once it is playing, use 'W A S D' keys and the 'UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT' arrows to control the respective players. First to 5 points wins.
